## Description ##

GTalkSMS enables you to **control your android phone through GTalk/XMPP** (send/receive SMS, make calls, locate your phone via GPS, activate WLAN or Bluetooth, etc.). It can be useful for those who prefer typing sms on a real keyboard. The app also notifies you about new "events" on the phone, like a new text message (SMS) or an incoming call. Think of it as an remote control for your android phone via GTalk/XMPP that informs you about recent events on your smartphone.

Also GTalkSMS is also **able to send and receive files from your phone**. You can take remote pictures from the front/back camera of your phone and send them via XMPP. [File-transfer works best with XMPP](http://code.google.com/p/gtalksms/wiki/FileTransfers).

On a rooted phone, GTalkSMS is able to take and send you a screenshot and also allows you to start a shell session which input/output is handled by GTalk/XMPP.

**An overview of the current feature set of GTalkSMS can be found [in the Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/gtalksms/wiki/FeaturesAndCommands)**
